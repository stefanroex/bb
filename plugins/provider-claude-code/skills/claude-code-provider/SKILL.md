# Claude Code provider

Read settings with `bb plugin config provider-claude-code`; change a declared key
with `bb plugin config provider-claude-code set <key> <value>`.

- `chromeEnabled` defaults to `false`. It starts Claude Code with `--chrome` for
  Claude in Chrome tools. The host needs the extension and a claude.ai login.
  A change restarts the thread's Claude process before its next turn, preserving
  context.
- `sandboxEnabled` defaults to `true`. In Accept Edits and Approve for me modes
  bb runs Claude Code's Bash commands in its sandbox. Set it to `false` to use
  Claude Code's own command approvals and sandbox settings instead. A change
  applies when a thread's Claude session starts or resumes.
- bb passes only `BB_CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE` and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` to
  the CLI. Mint the token with `claude setup-token` for machines with no
  interactive login.
- Structured plan, message editing, and compaction are supported through the
  corresponding `bb thread` commands. Unlisted model IDs are accepted by the
  provider; verify actual availability on the target host.

Inspect the thread and provider state after a change; do not restart unrelated
threads or change settings merely to answer a question.
